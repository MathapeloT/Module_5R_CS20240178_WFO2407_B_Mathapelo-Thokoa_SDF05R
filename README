# Styling My Buttons with CSS

## What I needed to do
 Create animated buttons using CSS from scratch.

 ## What I did
 - I decided to go through the  supplementary resources and opted to get inspiration from uiverse.com.
 - I went through a few pages before making the final decision on which buttons I wanted to create for this project.
 - The most difficult part of creating my buttons was getting them aligned properly as shown in the image in the starter code. I decided to go through the next module's conent so as to distract myself from the frustrations of my coding. I then discovered Flex and gave it a try. I was pleasanlty surprised when it actually worked.
 - My first button gave me the most stress as it did not turn out as I'd hoped but it is still functional. 
 - The third button that I created is my absolute favourite. It sparked a new love for my learning journey to see my own work come to life.
